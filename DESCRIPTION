Description: This R package jointly estimates tumor purity and somatic copy
    number across the genome, given a pair of tumor/normal samples sequenced using a
    targeted capture approach. It has been successfully used to analyze whole exome
    data as well as data from relatively large targeted panels (1500-1700 genes).
Depends:
